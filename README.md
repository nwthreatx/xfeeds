Public Threat Intelegence

This week ThreatX completed an off-site company get-together in Louisville, Colorado. With so many circumstances inhibiting in-person gatherings it was overdue and a welcomed way to rally the team behind our corporate visions; to stop attackers and change the cybersecurity landscape.  

Today, ThreatX team members volunteered time to “do good” events. These events focused on creating positive impacts in our communities and sharing our knowledge and resources. In the Security Operations Center, we investigated several attacks against our clients and have compiled a list of known bad-actors or attackers.  

The nature of ThreatX is to block or inhibit attackers from interacting with applications.  To do this we use an engine that informs Hackermind (our risk calculating oracle) of HTTP events that match with nefarious activity. Today, we analyzed 5 million match events to profile who is creating the HTTP traffic. We then validated IPs by running them through Graynoise to remove any additional noise from the IP list.  From our list Graynoise had previously seen 71 of the IPs, 33 of which Graynoise had already tagged as malicious.  This means that of the remaining 2901 IP addresses are new known-bad actors that can be added to threat intelligence feeds.  The list is contained here and sorted by ASNs.
